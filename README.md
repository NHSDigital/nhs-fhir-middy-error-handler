### Usage

To integrate this into your project, install the package using the following:

```bash
# TODO: Update this once package is published
```

## Project Structure

- `.devcontainer` Contains a dockerfile and vscode devcontainer definition
- `.github` Contains github workflows that are used for building and deploying from pull requests and releases
- `src` Contains the source code for the project
- `tests` Contains the tests for the project

## Development

It is recommended that you use visual studio code and a devcontainer as this will install all necessary components and correct versions of tools and languages.  
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers for details on how to set this up on your host machine.  
There is also a workspace file in .vscode that should be opened once you have started the devcontainer. The workspace file can also be opened outside of a devcontainer if you wish.  

All commits must be made using [signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

Once the steps at the link above have been completed. Add to your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf as below:

```
use-agent
pinentry-mode loopback
```

and to your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf as below:

```
allow-loopback-pinentry
```

As described here:

You will need to create the files, if they do not already exist.
This will ensure that your VSCode bash terminal prompts you for your GPG key password.

You can cache the gpg key passphrase by following instructions at https://superuser.com/questions/624343/keep-gnupg-credentials-cached-for-entire-user-session

### CI Setup

The GitHub Actions require a secret to exist on the repo called "SONAR_TOKEN".
This can be obtained from [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/)
as described [here](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/user-guide/user-account/generating-and-using-tokens/).
You will need the "Execute Analysis" permission for the project (NHSDigital_nhs-fhir-middy-error-handler) in order for the token to work.

### Pre-commit hooks

Some pre-commit hooks are installed as part of the install above, to run basic lint checks and ensure you can't accidentally commit invalid changes.
The pre-commit hook uses python package pre-commit and is configured in the file .pre-commit-config.yaml.
A combination of these checks are also run in CI.

### Make commands

There are `make` commands that are run as part of the CI pipeline and help alias some functionality during development.

#### Install targets

<!-- TODO -->
- `install`

#### Clean and deep-clean targets

- `clean` clears up any files that have been generated by building or testing locally.
- `deep-clean` runs clean target and also removes any node_modules installed locally.

#### Linting and testing

- `lint` runs lint for all code

#### Check licenses

- `check-licenses` checks licenses for all packages used
